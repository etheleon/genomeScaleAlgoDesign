/*
Same as 1-1,
In a given organism some codons are used more frequently than others to encode the same amino acid. Given the observed frequency of every codon in a species, normalize it into probabilities and write a program that, given a protein sequence, samples a random DNA sequence that encodes that protein under such codon usage probabilities.

So i guess you have to sample and produce one the DNA sequence from all probability space
