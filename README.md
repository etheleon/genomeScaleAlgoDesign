This repo serves to store PERL6 implementations of exercises found in Genome-Scale Algorithm Design Book (ISBN: 9781107078536).

Currently unsure if i should do this in Golang or Perl6. (Chose Perl6 because golang forces me to write very literal code)

So this will be done in PERL6 instead of Golang as most of the exercises are algorithms.

R is perfectly fine right now, no need for Julia.
I need a language which allows me to write succintly and assign type. (Perl6)
