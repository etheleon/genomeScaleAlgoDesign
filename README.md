This repo serves to store GOLANG implementations of exercises found in Veli Makinen _et al._ Genome-Scale Algorithm Design Book (ISBN: 9781107078536).


Currently unsure if i should do this in Julia or Golang. 

But believe algorithm design is different from data science. 

So this will be done in GOLANG instead of Julia as most of the exercises are algorithms
and not passaging data through analyses.

R is perfectly fine right now for Julia. I need a language which allows me to write succintly and assign type.
