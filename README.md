This repo serves to store PERL6 implementations of exercises found in Genome-Scale Algorithm Design Book (ISBN: 9781107078536).

Currently unsure if i should do this in Golang or Perl6. (Chose Perl6 because golang forces me to write very literal code)

So this will be done in both PERL6 and Golang.

R is perfectly fine right now, no need for Julia.

I need a language which allows me to write succintly and assign type. (Perl6, its slower than golang)
